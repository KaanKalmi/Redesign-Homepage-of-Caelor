# Caelor`s home page
Newly designed home page for Caelor

## Description
With the new homepage made for Caelor you can scroll through their apps for Confluence and Jira, all you have to do is navigate through the carousel!

The new design makes the site less straining on your eyes by going with a darker theme and less vibrant colors, while still being pleasant for the eye.

I have also prioritized the 'attention-keeping' content, thus the long paragraphs of text have been shortened with the idea of having content be 'short but powerful'.

## Client
